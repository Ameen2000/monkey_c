# monkey_c
This repo is the similar to the other monkey repo, but the implementation here is in C rather than OCaml.
The objective is to gain a decent understanding of the C programming language and it's various concepts that
are abstracted away or hidden from you in other programming languages such as pointers, manual memory management,
and header files.
